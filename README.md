# STAT184-HW-Template
 STAT184 Github Day 1 HW Template
**Introduction**
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate various data-wrangling techniques using a dataset of Oreo cookies. It includes the R code that demonstrates the techniques as well as the dataset itself.
**Implementation**
First, the code demonstrates how the "$" symbol can be used to specify a certain column of a table. Then it demonstrates to how index a table and get values based on their position or row in the dataset. Then it shows how to change certain values through indexing. Finally, it demonstrates two ways of filtering the dataset to only show regular type Oreos, first through the use of the "$" symbol, and then through chaining in dplyr.
**Results**
The majority of the resulting output of the code appears in the console (as it was not saved to an object) as lines of text displaying various rows or values defined by the code. The other two outputs are the two filtered datasets that we created, one named RegularOreosData which was created by using the "$" symbol and one named ChainRegularOreosData which was created by chaining in dplyr. Both datasets should have the exact same columns, rows, and values.
